An app to host and manage games.

Adventure Games

We will be developping an app which will handle input and 
basic management of common games played, many of which are
common in high school. Games such as Assassin and Pandemic 
are among the ones we want to start with. Players would be
able to check the app to get information on their next 
target or which players are remaining. They would also notify
of end of game, winners, your team score, etc.

Current thoughts on tables:
	Players(users)
	Friends list
	Games
	Teams
	Experience

Currently leaning towards a key-value database. Would love
to work with a team of three. 

As far as Business, for now, this is a project for class but
if we create something we think could be a lot of fun and 
bring people together, then this could become something more.
We'll look for opportunities to grow this into something more.

Legal: We plan to not violate any copyright laws.

Technical: Front end will be developed in Flutter in order
to get experience and also to develop for all platforms. Back
end is open to discussion. C# or Java would be preferred but 
this is open for discussion.
