An app to host and manage games.

Adventure Games

We will be developping an app which will handle input and 
basic management of common games played, many of which are
common in high school. Games such as Assassin and Pandemic 
are among the ones we want to start with. Players would be
able to check the app to get information on their next 
target or which players are remaining. They would also notify
of end of game, winners, your team score, etc.
