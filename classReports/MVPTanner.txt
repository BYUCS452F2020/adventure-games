	My role was to understand how the front and back ends connected together. I personally 
helped build all the various HTTP requests to send and receive data between the front and back 
ends. Overall, I think we have a very simple but functional product. Overall, if we were to
market and sell, we would probably need to create something with more impressive UI. However, for
the purposes of this class, it is very functional with a clean, normalized database. 
	For the presentation, I helped us decided how we would present. We had a discussion about
what we wanted to show off for our presentation. However, it was fairly simple for one person to 
present. So instead of having each person step in, we simply had one person do the presentation.
