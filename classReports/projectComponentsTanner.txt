Project Components:

The server is run on Collinâ€™s laptop. It handles all requests sent to the back end. 

We are using MySQL for our relational database software service.

Database server: SQL
Web server: Java
Client machine: Flutter, a mix of Android and IOS

The different pieces of the project connect through HTTP requests. By sending and receiving these,
the front end and back end are able to communicate with each other. The back end is able to 
communicate with the database server through a database connection string. The string contains the 
address of the database and the authentication parameters required to access it.

I personally helped build all the various HTTP requests to send and receive data between the front
and back ends. Overall, I think we have a very simple but functional product. Overall, if we were to
market and sell, we would probably need to create something with more impressive UI. However, for
the purposes of this class, it is very functional with a clean, normalized database.
